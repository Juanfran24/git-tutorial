## Why do i think GIT and GITHUB are important ?

### Reasons:

* Git is pretty awesome whenever we want to make little changes to a file or a project, and be sure of them, because if we have to get
back to a past version like "when worked fine", we can make it with a simple command instead of creating multiple copies of a project 
and saving them in different locations as we would do it without a C.V.S
* GitHub is like a social network where we can share our fantastic creations to the world.
* It is open source and also projects that anyone can upload (if they want).
